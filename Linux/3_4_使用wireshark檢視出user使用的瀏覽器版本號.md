## 題目分析
```
We can get into the Administrator's computer with a browser exploit.
But first, we need to figure out what browser they're using.
Perhaps this information is located in a network packet capture we took: data3.pcap.
Enter the browser and version as "BrowserName BrowserVersion".

NOTE: We're just looking for up to 3 levels of subversions for the browser version 
(ie. Version 1.2.3 for Version 1.2.3.4) and ignore any 0th subversions (ie. 1.2 for 1.2.0)

Hint:

Where can we find information on the browser in networking data?
Maybe try reading up on user-agent strings.
```
- [data3.pcap]()
- 1.題目要我們找瀏覽器版本號 `BrowserName BrowserVersion`
- 2.瀏覽器版本號在三個小數以上才是答案  looking for up to 3 levels of subversions for the browser version
- 題目暗示:
  - Where can we find information on the browser in networking data? Maybe try reading up on user-agent strings.
  - 在`user-agent`字串

## 解題步驟
- 步驟1:使用wireshark來開啟pcap檔
- 步驟2:在display filter 欄位中輸入http.request(請求)，只查看http 請求的封包
- 步驟3:選中一個封包 按右鍵 > Follow > TCP Stream
- 步驟4:逐項檢視所選的封包 即可找到答案
